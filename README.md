## 👋 Hi, I'm Sumeet Bhosale

I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student focused om building strong fundamentals in Python, Data Science, and Machine Leaning.

I prefer understanding systems deeply over rushing through frameworks.
My goal is to grow into a solid ML/AI engineer through real projects and disciplined practice.
